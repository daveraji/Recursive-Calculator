# Recursive-Calculator

Built this Calculator Example to test out a few skills that I've been working on. Work in progress that I'll build on.  
Right now it solves problems and brackets recursively - Uses Flask to host the UI on the web. Test program included. 

Things to Add
-----------
- Improve the UI 
- More involved testing protocols 
- Have the buttons add values at the cursor not just the end
- Add database of Answers
